                    <p id = "para101">What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips 
                        down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing 
                        over 800 people to one of our favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and 
                        welcomed them to our family. The season started off with some chilly weather in the 
                        early season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip. 
                        Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 
                        on the Salmon. We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water 
                        at those temperatures.</p>

                        States. We share these areas with lots of critters both large and small. Here are 
                        some tips on what to do if you should find yourself face to face with one.

                        <b>Scorpions:</b> There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them being harmless. 
                        There are, however, a handful of them that can be dangerous and even potentially lethal. 
                        Scorpions can be found in almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their 
                        environment. The scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the 
                        Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the United States. Do not worry though, the bark 
                        scorpions are only lethal to their prey and luckily humans are not on that list!

                        They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will eat crickets, 
                        moths, spiders and other insects. Many compare their sting to an intense bee sting. 
                        Relief can be found with ice, aspirin and time.
                    </p>
                    <p id = "para101">                        
                        When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night. Always wear 
                        your shoes or sandals. Always have a light with you to see where you are going. 
                        Never try to capture a scorpion and if you get stung, see your guide immediately.

                        <b>Big horn sheep:</b> For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain west. 
                        It is one of two species of wild sheep in North America. It’s compact body is muscular 
                        with chocolate brown fur. Most weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing 
                        and smell that helps them detect and avoid predators.

                        Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have horns but they are 
                        short with a slight curvature. Horns are used as tools for eating and fighting.
                    </p>

                        If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park service asks that you 
                        stay 100 feet away from big game animals. Leave them enough room for escape if they 
                        feel threatened.
