    <p>Kia Ora (Greetings) Class mates, My name is Nga Hirinuki (Elder Hirinuki) currently serving a Service Mission for BYU Pathway Connect in Auckland, New Zealand with my wife. This is my first semester in BYU Idaho, studying Software Development. My wife and I were converted to the church in 2001. We have four kids, our daughter in law is currently in her second year of studying online at BYU Idaho, and two beautiful mokopunas (grandkids). My career background is in graphic design(self taught) and I want to see how I can connect the two pathways to increase my business opportunities. I love watching the All Blacks, our national sport and a KPOP show called Fantastic Duo because it reminds me of the RnB songs from the ninties. I l am looking forward to this class.
        </p><p>I love 1 Nephi 3:7 especially how the lord prepares a way for us to acomplish our education.
    </p>
