      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of my website is to promote my services to small businesses with or without a website. Offer 3-level packages Gold Silver and Bronze. 
        The landing page will have a brief description. Of what we do. With a brief intro of the 3 packages and examples of former clients(fake clients) 
        and a call to action. 1st Child page will go over the packages in-depth and the 2 Child page will be about us and maybe an infographic of the 
        client's journey through the process.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audience is small business owners who have a website who needs it updated and new small businesses, schools, and non–profit organizations.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Brainstorm and Write</h3>
      <h4>Why will people come to your site?</h4> 
        <p>If a customer lands on my page it’s because they need a problem solved. Customers are clear on what they want and the 
          site needs to be transparent on what it is offering. The main objective of the website is to provide a service that meets 
          the customer's needs. The service is essentially building websites at 3 different levels. One, three, or five-page websites. 
          We can build websites from scratch or revamp an existing site. Our targeted audience that I want to attract but not limited 
          to are small businesses old and new,  schools, and non-profit organizations. The clients that I am targeting to are not big 
          spenders so I know that I need to be transparent with what the site provides.</p>
        <h4>questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</h4> 
        <p>site needs to be clear, concise, and transparent. The customer needs to find their way around the site easily and be able 
        to identify what I offer. Examples need to be relevant and updated. They need to know, see and feel the site is not going to 
        rip them off. They need to be convinced that the website can meet their needs and only then they would fill out a form, send 
        an email, and make contact. Step-by-step progress on what to expect from us. </p>
        <h4>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</h4>
        <p>activities, the prospecting customer needs to make sure, the information from the site can deliver the solution to their 
        website needs. Make sure they understand the step-by-step process of how engagement works in delivering a website. Once they 
        search through examples and qualify that they like what I do, then contact is made by email. Another way to engage in work is 
        by choosing the package that they want and replying with inquiries.</p>
        <h4>What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</h4>
        <p>Once the customer qualifies us to do the work, forms or emails are sent to us. Then engage the customer, set terms of the 
        agreement is sent for signoff. Then commencement and payment are done, then work commences.</p>
        <h4>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?</h4>
        <p>When we go to a supermarket and we are shopping for orange juice. We know that there are more than 3 choices to choose from. 
          Many factors influence their choice of juice. There is no one size that fits all. So is the same as my customers choosing to 
          work with me. Deciphering through the options can be hectic. Customers know what they want. I just need to be transparent 
          with what I offer and that they have everything needed to make that decision.</p><!-- change this -->
